OSCOMMERCE 2.4 (JOLI) REMIBIT MODULE

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

In order to install the module, it is necessary to access the server where the web files are hosted by ssh. If you donâ€™t know how to do that, please contact your site administrator or your hosting provider.

In this example we will be using the default oscommerce configuration, so the website files are located in /var/www/html/oscommerce. Please replace [oscommerce] with the actual name of your website directory.

## Requirements

* A RemiBit merchant account
* oscommerce 2.4


## Installation

1/. Go to the oscommerce directory

```
cd /var/www/html/oscommerce
```

2/. Fetch the RemiBit module

```
sudo unzip oscommerce24-remibit.zip
